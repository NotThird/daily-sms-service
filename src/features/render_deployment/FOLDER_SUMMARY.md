- Implemented database connection pooling with PgBouncer support
- Added health check caching mechanism
- Implemented environment variable validation
- Added deploy hook signature validation
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Added detailed documentation

## Integration with Project

This feature integrates with the following project components:

1. **Database Management**
   - Enhances database connection handling with pooling
   - Coordinates with database migrations during deployment

2. **Deployment Monitoring**
   - Provides health check caching
   - Integrates with existing monitoring systems

3. **Core Application**
   - Validates environment configuration
   - Manages deployment security

## Dependencies

See PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for overall project architecture. This feature specifically depends on:

- PostgreSQL database
- Render platform services
- PgBouncer connection pooling
- Flask web framework

## Security & Performance

### Security Measures
- Deploy hook signature validation
- Environment variable validation
- Sensitive data sanitization

### Performance Optimizations
- Database connection pooling
- Health check response caching
- Zero-downtime deployment support

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for Render's autoscaling features
2. Implement advanced database failover strategies
3. Add deployment metrics collection
4. Enhance zero-downtime deployment coordination
