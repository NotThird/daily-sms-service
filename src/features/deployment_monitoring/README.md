# Deployment Monitoring Feature

This feature provides comprehensive deployment verification and monitoring capabilities for ensuring the health and proper configuration of deployed applications.

## Purpose

The deployment monitoring feature performs thorough checks of various system components and configurations to verify that a deployment is functioning correctly. It includes:

- Health endpoint verification
- Webhook authentication validation
- Message scheduling system checks
- Database connection verification
- SSL certificate validation
- Rate limiting configuration checks
- Logging system verification

## Usage

### Basic Deployment Verification

```python
from features.deployment_monitoring.code import verify_deployment

# Verify deployment status
success = verify_deployment(
    url="https://api.example.com",
    twilio_sid="your_twilio_sid",
    twilio_token="your_twilio_token"
)

if success:
    print("Deployment verification passed")
else:
    print("Deployment verification failed")
```

### Using DeploymentVerifier Directly

```python
from features.deployment_monitoring.code import DeploymentVerifier

# Initialize verifier with custom retry settings
verifier = DeploymentVerifier(
    base_url="https://api.example.com",
    twilio_sid="your_twilio_sid",
    twilio_token="your_twilio_token",
    max_retries=3  # Configure maximum retry attempts
)

# Run individual checks
if verifier.verify_health_endpoint():
    print("Health check passed")

if verifier.verify_ssl_certificate():
    print("SSL certificate is valid")

# Run all checks
results = verifier.run_all_checks()
for check, passed in results.items():
    print(f"{check}: {'Passed' if passed else 'Failed'}")
```

## Logic

The feature implements multiple verification checks:

1. **Health Endpoint**: Verifies the application's health check endpoint returns proper status
2. **Webhook Authentication**: Ensures Twilio webhook endpoints require proper authentication
3. **Message Scheduling**: Checks recent message delivery status through Twilio
4. **Database Connection**: Verifies database connectivity through the application
5. **SSL Certificate**: Validates SSL certificate status and expiration
6. **Rate Limiting**: Tests rate limiting configuration
7. **Logging**: Verifies logging system operation

### Security Practices

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Uses secure HTTPS connections with certificate validation
2. **Authentication Verification**: Ensures webhook endpoints require proper authentication

### Performance & Reliability Features

1. **Connection Pooling**: Uses session-based connection pooling for HTTP requests to improve response times
2. **Retry Logic**: Implements exponential backoff retry mechanism for all verification checks
   - Configurable maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
   - Exponential delay between retries (starts at 1 second)
   - Automatic error handling and logging
   - Graceful degradation after max retries

## Testing

The feature includes comprehensive tests covering both typical usage and edge cases:

```bash
# Run tests
pytest src/features/deployment_monitoring/tests.py
```

Test coverage includes:
- Successful verification scenarios
- Failed verification handling
- Edge cases for each verification type
- Mock-based testing for external dependencies
- Retry mechanism validation
- Error handling verification

### Test Requirements

- pytest
- unittest.mock for mocking external services
- requests for HTTP operations
- twilio-python for Twilio API integration
- backoff for retry mechanism testing

## Dependencies

- requests: For HTTP operations
- twilio: For message scheduling verification
- logging: For operation logging
- backoff: For implementing retry logic
- Python 3.6+ for type hints support
