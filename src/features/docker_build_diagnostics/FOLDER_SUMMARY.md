# Docker Build Diagnostics Feature

## Overview
This feature provides automated analysis and resolution suggestions for Docker build errors, with a particular focus on package installation issues. It integrates with the project's deployment and monitoring capabilities to improve build reliability.

## Recent Updates
- Initial implementation of Docker build error diagnostics
- Added support for apt-get package installation error analysis
- Implemented security measures and performance optimizations

## Files
- `code.py`: Core implementation of error analysis and resolution
- `tests.py`: Comprehensive test suite for all components
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation and usage examples

## Integration with PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
This feature enhances the project's deployment capabilities by:
- Providing automated error analysis for Docker builds
- Suggesting solutions for common build failures
- Implementing secure error handling practices
- Optimizing build diagnostics performance

## Dependencies
- Python standard library (re, dataclasses, typing)
- No external package dependencies required

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for error message parsing
- Protection against command injection
- Secure handling of build context information

## Performance Optimizations
- LRU caching for frequent error patterns
- Efficient regex-based parsing
- Optimized solution lookup
