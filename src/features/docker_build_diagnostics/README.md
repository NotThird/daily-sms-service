# Docker Build Diagnostics

A feature for analyzing and resolving Docker build errors, with a focus on package installation issues.

## Purpose

This feature provides automated analysis of Docker build errors, particularly focusing on package installation failures. It helps identify common issues and provides actionable solutions.

## Usage

```python
from features.docker_build_diagnostics.code import analyze_build_error

# Example error output from Docker build
error_output = 'error: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c apt-get update" did not complete successfully: exit code: 100'

# Get solution suggestions
solutions = analyze_build_error(error_output)
for solution in solutions:
    print(f"- {solution}")
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. `DockerBuildError` class
   - Parses and structures Docker build errors
   - Extracts error code, stage, and failed command
   - Implements input sanitization for security

2. `ErrorResolver` class
   - Analyzes errors and generates solution suggestions
   - Implements LRU caching for performance optimization
   - Provides context-aware solutions based on error type

### Security Measures

1. Input Validation
   - Sanitizes error messages to prevent command injection
   - Removes potentially harmful shell operators

2. Secure Error Handling
   - Avoids exposing sensitive build context in error messages
   - Implements safe error parsing and validation

### Performance Optimization

- LRU caching of frequent error patterns
- Efficient regex-based error parsing
- Optimized solution lookup based on error characteristics

## Testing

Run the tests using pytest:

```bash
pytest src/features/docker_build_diagnostics/tests.py
```

The test suite covers:
- Error parsing functionality
- Solution generation
- Security measures
- Performance optimizations
- Edge cases and error handling
