  - DatabaseManager class for handling database operations
  - Secure database operations with SQL injection prevention
  - Performance-optimized backup/restore operations
  - Complete migration workflow implementation

- `tests.py`: Comprehensive test suite
  - Unit tests for all database operations
  - Mock-based testing for external dependencies
  - Edge case and error handling coverage

- `README.md`: Detailed documentation
  - Usage examples and code snippets
  - Security and performance features
  - Testing instructions
  - Dependency information

## Recent Updates

- Initial feature implementation with secure database operations
